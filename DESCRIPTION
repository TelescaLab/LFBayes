Description: This package is used for analyzing longitudinal functional
    data in a Bayesian fashion. Longitudinal functional data is functional
    data repeated over longitudinal time. This package uses Gibbs sampling to draw
    From the joint posterior and conduct inference. Inferential objects of interest
    are smoothed 2D means and marginal eigenfunctions in both the longitudinal and
    Functional directions. Regularization is completed through a Gamma Multiplicative
    Process Prior on key model quantities. See our manuscript at 
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08763.pdf for more details.
